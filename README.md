# smssplit
UI to explain how messages are split in SMS

Use here: http://chadselph.github.io/smssplit/

**Caveat**: Different sms gateways and different mobile operators across the world sometimes do things differently, this is just an example that can usually explain why your message got split. Hint: it's usually because of a punctuation mark or whitespace that isn't encodable in GSM.

Here's a [Python API](https://github.com/chrisconlon-klaviyo/sms-toolkit) based on this algorithm.

Let's see if Windu gets credit!
